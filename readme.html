<p>
  This project runs a server that can give a login and registration pages. <br>
  if the user is logged in the server sends a weather page. <br>
  the server also manages the data base and serves a rest api for the user to operate on the data base.
</p>

<h3>Notes: </h3>
<p>
  <b>data base operations</b> <br>
  We made a protected rest api that gives the user the option to operate his data base.
  <br>
  the api will send 400 error if the user isn't logged in.
</p>
<p>
  <b>data base structure</b> <br>
  There is two tables in our data base, first a <b>users</b> table which contains all users info. <br>
  the second table is a <b>places</b> table which contains all places that users saved, with the id of the user that saved the place.
</p>
<p>
  <b>migrations file</b> <br>
  We used the sequelize-mig library in order to create the migration file based on the model files.
</p>
<p>
  <b>loading animation</b> <br>
  We made a beautiful css loading animation based on this code snippet from <a href="https://codepen.io/ispal/pen/mVaaJe">codepen</a>
